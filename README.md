# Zombie-Shooter-in-Scratch
A simple top down zombie shooter in Scratch (My first code). 

Hello World.

This is my first ever coding project. It is a top down zombie shooter game in Scratch. It is incredibly simple and I am
uploading it to GitHub simply to submerge myself in the coding world. Any revisions or fixes are welcome. Just shoot me
a PM. Thanks all.

Also, very new and dont know how to use GitHub, but I am trying to implement a final score counter in the death screen
in my game. I am creating a pull request. Please help.
